# Back End Development
Back end development refers to the server side of an application and everything that communicates between the database and the browser. The backend of an application is responsible for things like calculations, business logic, database interactions and performance. Most of the code that is required to make an application work will be done on the backend. Backend developers not only need to understand programming languages and databases, but they must have an understanding of server architecture as well.
